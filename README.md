# Pizza-Sales-Report
Project Purpose:

I designed a Pizza Sales Dashboard using Power BI to provide comprehensive insights into our pizza business. The dashboard aims to help us understand our sales performance, customer preferences, and key trends.

About the Data:

The project utilizes a dataset spanning from January 1st, 2015, to December 31st, 2015, containing 16 columns and 48,000 rows. This dataset comprises detailed information about our pizza orders, including order dates, pizza categories, sizes, quantities, and revenue generated.

Approach Used:

The dashboard employs a variety of visualizations and slicers for interactive exploration. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Total Orders, and Average Order Value provide an overview of our business's financial health. Graphs reveal daily and monthly sales trends, aiding in identifying seasonality and growth opportunities.

The slicer functionality allows users to filter data by pizza category, enabling a deep dive into category-specific insights. Additionally, the dashboard identifies our top and bottom-performing pizzas, highlighting those contributing the most and least to our revenue, quantity, and order count.

Overall, this project aims to empower data-driven decision-making within our pizza business by uncovering patterns and actionable insights from our sales data.
